Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

## Lectures and labs

If you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

## Office hours

The teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours during the times posted on the home page to ask questions about the course content and assignments. A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. I encourage each and every one of you to take advantage of this resource! Make a pledge to stop by office hours at least once during the first three weeks of class. If you truly have no questions to ask, just stop by and say hi and introduce yourself. You can find a list of everyone's office hours [here](/course-team.html).

## Discussion forum

Have a question that can't wait for office hours? Prefer to write out your question in detail rather than asking in person? The online discussion forum is the best venue for these! We will use [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/join/Xjcr2d) as the online discussion forum. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Ed Discussion before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question that is posted, I encourage you to respond!

## Email

Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go [Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/join/Xjcr2d)), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g., illness, accommodations, etc.). For such matters, you may email Dr. Kara McCormack at [kmcco\@unc.edu](mailto:kmcco@unc.edu).

If there is a question that's not appropriate for the public forum, you are welcome to email me directly. **If you email me, please include "BIOS 600" in the subject line.** Barring extenuating circumstances, I will respond to BIOS 600 emails within 48 hours Monday - Friday. Response time may be slower for emails sent Friday evening - Sunday.

## Academic support

There are times you may need help with the class that is beyond what can be provided by the teaching team. In those instances, I encourage you to visit **The Learning Center**. [The Learning Center](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/) offers free services to all students at UNC. (The website says it's for undergraduates, but graduate students are welcome, too!) Services include individual academic coaching appointments, peer tutoring, STEM coaching groups, and more. The Learning Center services are available free to any UNC student. Contact The Learning Center to schedule an appointment.  Contact [learning_center@unc.edu](mailto:learning_center@unc.edu), 919-962-7710.

## Mental health and wellness

Student mental health and wellness is of primary importance at UNC, and the university offers resources to support students in managing daily stress and self-care. UNC offers several resources for students to seek assistance on coursework and to nurture daily habits that support overall well-being, some of which are listed below:

-   **UNC Student Wellness**: (919) 962-9355, [studentwellness\@unc.edu](mailto:studentwellness@unc.edu), or [studentwellness.unc.edu](https://studentwellness.unc.edu/),

If your mental health concerns and/or stressful events negatively affect your daily emotional state, academic performance, or ability to participate in your daily activities, Counseling and Psychological Services are available to help you through difficult times. 

-   **Counseling and Psychological Services**: (919) 966-3658, [caps\@unc.edu](mailto:caps@unc.edu), or [caps.unc.edu](https://caps.unc.edu)
