Due Friday, Aug 23 at 5pm. 

# Welcome

## Meet the TA

## **What to expect in lab**

-   Introduction to the lab assignment (\~ 5 - 10 minutes)

-   Work on the lab assignment (individual at first, but in teams for the rest of the semester)

-   Lab instructions posted on the [course website](https://bios600-f24.github.io/website/ "BIOS 600 Course website").


## **Tips**

-   You do not have to finish the lab in class, they will always be due the following **Friday at 5:00 pm**. One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.

-   When working in teams (later in the semester) do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

## A quick note

- Today's lab introduces the computing tools we will be using this semester. 

- We will begin by installing R and RStudio, and familiarizing ourselves with its basic functionality. 

- We will also introduce Quarto as a tool to create high-quality reproducible reports - don't worry, a fillable template is provided. We will conclude by creating data visualizations in ggplot2 (part of the tidyverse, more on that in class on Thursday). 

**This is an individual lab. Your TAs will guide you through the first portion of the lab (until the "On your own" section).** 

## Installation

R is a statistical programming language used for computation, data analysis, and graphics generation. It is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and applied researchers in many fields. 

### Benefits of R

- flexible and freely available to the public, who have in turn written many user-contributed **packages** which provide additional functionality. 

- RStudio is a convenient interface for R that adds convenient features, such as exporting output in nice formats. 

- In this class, we'll be doing all of our computation in RStudio. 

Let's begin by installing R and RStudio. First, we need to install R, which can be [downloaded here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
