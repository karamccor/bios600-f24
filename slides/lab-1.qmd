Due Friday, Aug 23 at 5pm. 

# Welcome

## Meet the TA

![](images/hello-sticker.jpeg){width=300}

## **What to expect in lab**

-   Introduction to the lab assignment (\~ 5 - 10 minutes)

-   Work on the lab assignment (individual at first, but will switch to teams in a few weeks.)

-   Lab instructions posted on the [course website](https://bios600-f24.github.io/website/ "BIOS 600 Course website").


## **Tips**

-   You do not have to finish the lab in class, they will always be due the following **Friday at 5:00 pm**. One work strategy is to get through portions that you think will be most challenging (which initially might be the coding component) during lab when a TA can help you on the spot and leave the narrative writing until later.

-   When working in teams (later in the semester) do not pressure each other to finish early; use the time wisely to really learn the material and produce a quality report.

## A quick note

- Today's lab introduces the computing tools we will be using this semester. 

- We will begin by installing R and RStudio, and familiarizing ourselves with its basic functionality. 

- We will also introduce Quarto as a tool to create high-quality reproducible reports - don't worry, a fillable template is provided. We will conclude by creating data visualizations in ggplot2 (part of the tidyverse, more on that in class on Thursday). 

**This is an individual lab. Your TAs will guide you through the first portion of the lab (until the "On your own" section).** 

## Installation

R is a statistical programming language used for computation, data analysis, and graphics generation. It is widely used by statisticians, data scientists, and applied researchers in many fields. 

### Benefits of R

- flexible and freely available to the public, who have in turn written many user-contributed **packages** which provide additional functionality. 

- RStudio is a convenient interface for R that adds convenient features, such as exporting output in nice formats. 

- In this class, we'll be doing all of our computation in RStudio. 

Let's begin by installing R and RStudio. First, we need to install R, which can be [downloaded here](https://cran.r-project.org/) (see screenshot below).

Next, install RStudio Desktop, which can be [downloaded here](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (see screenshot below).

## First Steps in RStudio

With R and RStudio installed, we'll begin by exploring RStudio: the interface, reading in data, and basic commands. Upon opening RStudio, you should see something similar to the window below:

![](C:/Users/kmcco/OneDrive - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill/Documents/UNC_Teaching/fall2024/bios600-f24/labs/images/lab-1/r3.png)

The **console** is the panel on the left side, and is where users can type commands and see immediate output. Let's try it out! Type the following code into the console:

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
3 + 5
```
You should get output that looks like

```{r}
3 + 5
```
(For now, ignore the `[1]`). By typing in `3+5`, we got the expected answer, `8`. We can see that R can be used as a calculator directly in the console. Try some other commands that use R as a calculator. For instance, `3*25`, `exp(2)`, or `(10+5^2)/sqrt(40)`. Of course, R is not simply a calculator; other commands may also be entered here. 

To illustrate, let's load a dataset. Enter the following command into the console (you can directly copy/paste it, but make sure everything is exactly as below):

```{r echo = T}
# temporary
cdc <- read.csv("https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta102.001/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")

# what it should eventually be once I get the website up
# cdc <- read.csv("https://bios600-f24.github.io/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")
```

We've just loaded a dataset named `cdc`. These data come primarily from the Sortable Risk Factors and Health Indicators dataset from the CDC, which omprises demographic and health indices compiled from various federal sources. This dataset is now part of our **environment**, which is displayed on the top half and right side of the RStudio window. 

- The environment contains all objects in the current working space. These objects could be variables, lists of variables, or even entire datasets. 

- In the same location as the environment tab, the **history tab displays all commands used during the current session (don't worry about the connections tab for now). 

- Finally, the bottom half of the right-hand panel shows information regarding files on your hard drive, installed packages, output such as plots, and help files or other documents. 

coming back to the dataset we loaded in, we can see that it is named `cdc`. We can take a look at this dataset in a spreadsheet-like window by clicking on `cdc` in the Environment tab to the right, or by running the following code in the console:

```{r echo = T}
View(cdc)
```
