# Welcome

## Announcements

-   If you're just joining the class, welcome! Go to the [course website](https://bios600-fa24.github.io/website) and review content you've missed, read the syllabus, and complete the *Getting to know you* survey on Canvas.
-   Lab 1 is due Friday, at 5pm, on Canvas.

## Outline

-   How are data typically measured and organized?
-   Types of measurement scales
-   Data quality
-   Imprecision and bias

# Organization of data

## Measurement

-   **Measurement** is how we get our data
-   "the assignment of numbers or codes according to prior-set rules"
    -   Example: positioning observations along a numerical continuum (e.g. determining a person's age)
    -   Example: classifying observations into categories (e.g. determining whether someone is positive or negative for HIV antibodies)

## Observation

-   **Observation** refers to the unit upon which measurements are made.
-   May correspond to people or specimens (or countries, or counties, etc.)
-   May also correspond to aggregates
    -   smoking habits of *individual* (in term of "pack-years" for instance), unit of observation = person, vs.
    -   smoking habits of a *region* (e.g. per capita cigarette consumption), unit of observation = region.

## Observations, variables, and values

-   **Observations** are the units upon which measurements are made
-   **Variables** are the characteristics being measured
-   **Values** are realized measurements

## Data table

-   Once data are collected, they are organized to form a data table.

    -   Observations --\> rows
    -   Variables --\> columns
    -   Values --\> table cells

## Example: Per capita cigarette consumption {.smaller}

-   Per capita cigarette consumption in 1930 (cig1930) and lung cancer cases per 100,000 in 1950 (lungca) in 11 countries

| Country       | cig1930 | lungca |
|---------------|:--------|-------:|
| USA           | 1300    |     20 |
| Great Britain | 1100    |     46 |
| Finland       | 1100    |     35 |
| Switzerland   | 510     |     25 |
| Canada        | 500     |     15 |
| Holland       | 490     |     24 |


# Types of measurement scales

## Categorical measurements

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Nominal data

- named categories without numeric meaning
- only two categories: binary or dichotomous
- Breast cancer status, blood type, health insurance provider type, etc.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Ordinal data

- Ordered categories, but differences between values not easily measured
- Relative comparisons made about differences between levels
- Stage of colon cancer, Likert scale, frequency of smoking (often, sometimes, rarely, never), etc. 
:::

::::



## Numerical data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Count or rank data

- discrete counts. Or ranks.
- Number of alcoholic drinks consumed in past week, numerical rank of cancers by mortality, etc. 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Continuous data

- Measurable quantities where difference between possible values can be arbitrarily small
- Data may lie within a range or be unbounded
- Birth weight, BMI, ppm ozome, etc.

## Identifying data types

# Data quality

## Garbage in, garbage out

- Sophisticated numerical analysis cannot compensate for poor-quality data. 
- Statisticians have a saying for this: "garbage in, garbage out". 
- **Objectivity**: intent to measure things as they are without shaping them to conform to a preconcieved worldview

## Complications

In designing a study, what variable should we use for smoking exposure?

- Binary variable yes/no?
- Ordinal current/former/never smoker?
- Discrete number of cigarettes smoked in past week?
- Continuous measurement of lifetime pack-years?

In the real world, decisions are made based on sample size, statistical power, likelihood of measurement error, or simply convenience (this happens a lot!)

## Two types of inaccuracies

- **Imprecision** is the random inability to get the same result upon repetition 
- **Bias** is a systematic deviation from the truth. 
- When something is **unbiased**, it is said to be valid.

# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Initial data analysis approach that summarizes main characteristics of dataset

- Often visual or in the form of basic summary statistics

## Data visualization

- The creation and study of the visual representation of data
- Many tools available (R is populat, many systems within R for data visualization)
- Creating visualizations helps us see patterns and identify potential data quality issues
- We will focus on ggplot2, a component of tidyverse

## Visualizing CDC data

Let's take a look at some basic visualizations using state-level data collected by CDC. We'll examine the following variables:

- State (categorical; nominal)
- HDI (categorical; ordinal)
- Region (categorical; nominal)
- Adult obesity % (numerical; continuous)
- Adequate aerobic activity % (numerical; continuous)

## Bar charts

## Box plots

## Histograms

## Line plots

## Scatterplots

## Some best practices



## Recap

- Biostatistics involves a broad range of activities that help us improve the intellectual content of data from biological, biomedical, and public health-related studies; it is more than just a compilation of computational methods. 

- Measurement is assigning numbers or codes according to prior-set rules
