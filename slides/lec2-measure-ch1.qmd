-   Types of measurement scales
-   Data quality
-   Imprecision and bias

# Organization of data

## Measurement

-   **Measurement** is how we get our data
-   "the assignment of numbers or codes according to prior-set rules"
    -   Example: positioning observations along a numerical continuum (e.g. determining a person's age)
    -   Example: classifying observations into categories (e.g. determining whether someone is positive or negative for HIV antibodies)

## Observation

-   **Observation** refers to the unit upon which measurements are made.
-   May correspond to people or specimens (or countries, or counties, etc.)
-   May also correspond to aggregates
    -   smoking habits of *individual* (in term of "pack-years" for instance), unit of observation = person, vs.
    -   smoking habits of a *region* (e.g. per capita cigarette consumption), unit of observation = region.

## Observations, variables, and values

-   **Observations** are the units upon which measurements are made
-   **Variables** are the characteristics being measured
-   **Values** are realized measurements

## Data table

-   Once data are collected, they are organized to form a data table.

    -   Observations --\> rows
    -   Variables --\> columns
    -   Values --\> table cells

## Example: Per capita cigarette consumption {.smaller}

-   Per capita cigarette consumption in 1930 (cig1930) and lung cancer cases per 100,000 in 1950 (lungca) in 11 countries

| Country       | cig1930 | lungca |
|---------------|:--------|-------:|
| USA           | 1300    |     20 |
| Great Britain | 1100    |     46 |
| Finland       | 1100    |     35 |
| Switzerland   | 510     |     25 |
| Canada        | 500     |     15 |
| Holland       | 490     |     24 |


# Types of measurement scales

## Categorical measurements

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Nominal data

- named categories without numeric meaning
- only two categories: binary or dichotomous
- Breast cancer status, blood type, health insurance provider type, etc.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Ordinal data

- Ordered categories, but differences between values not easily measured
- Relative comparisons made about differences between levels
- Stage of colon cancer, Likert scale, frequency of smoking (often, sometimes, rarely, never), etc. 
:::

::::



## Numerical data

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Count or rank data

- discrete counts. Or ranks.
- Number of alcoholic drinks consumed in past week, numerical rank of cancers by mortality, etc. 

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Continuous data

- Measurable quantities where difference between possible values can be arbitrarily small
- Data may lie within a range or be unbounded
- Birth weight, BMI, ppm ozome, etc. 
:::

## Identifying data types

# Data quality

## Garbage in, garbage out

- Sophisticated numerical analysis cannot compensate for poor-quality data. 
- Statisticians have a saying for this: "garbage in, garbage out". 
- **Objectivity**: intent to measure things as they are without shaping them to conform to a preconcieved worldview

## Complications

In designing a study, what variable should we use for smoking exposure?

- Binary variable yes/no?
- Ordinal current/former/never smoker?
- Discrete number of cigarettes smoked in past week?
- Continuous measurement of lifetime pack-years?

In the real world, decisions are made based on sample size, statistical power, likelihood of measurement error, or simply convenience (this happens a lot!)

## Two types of inaccuracies

- **Imprecision** is the random inability to get the same result upon repetition 
- **Bias** is a systematic deviation from the truth. 
- When something is **unbiased**, it is said to be valid.

## Example

# Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Initial data analysis approach that summarizes main characteristics of dataset

- Often visual or in the form of basic summary statistics

## Data visualization

- The creation and study of the visual representation of data
- Many tools available (R is popular, many systems within R for data visualization)
- Creating visualizations helps us see patterns and identify potential data quality issues
- We will focus on ggplot2, a component of tidyverse

## ggplot2 in tidyverse

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- The tidyverse is a group of R packages designed for data science
- All tidyverse packages share an underlying design philosophy
- Data visualization package in the tidyverse
- Inspired by *The Grammar of Graphics* (Wilkinson)

## What is a Grammar of Graphics?

- A system allowing for concise description of graphical components

![](images/lec-2/gg.png){width=300}


## What is a Grammar of Graphics?

A statistical graphic is

- data (which may be statistically summarized or transformed)
- **mapped** to **aesthetic** attributes (color, size, xy-position, etc.)
- using **geometries** (points, lines, bars, etc.)
- mapped onto a specific **coordinate** and/or **facet** system

## Visualizing CDC data

Let's take a look at some basic visualizations using state-level data collected by CDC. We'll examine the following variables:

- State (categorical; nominal)
- HDI (categorical; ordinal)
- Region (categorical; nominal)
- Adult obesity % (numerical; continuous)
- Adequate aerobic activity % (numerical; continuous)

## Bar charts

```{r}
cdc <- read.csv("https://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Spring21/sta102.001/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")

# write.csv(cdc, "C:/Users/kmcco/OneDrive - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill/Documents/UNC_Teaching/fall2024/bios600-f24/labs/data/cdc_cleaned.csv")
```

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  count(Region) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Region, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "salmon2") +
  ggtitle("The South has the largest number of states")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}

- Summarizes numerical variable by categories
- Visually depict frequency distributions for nominal or ordinal data
- Bars represent either frequency or relative frequency by category
- Separation between bars (non-continuous data)
- May contain error bars to indicate estimate variability

## Box plots

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  ggplot(aes(x=HDI, y = Obesity)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ggtitle("Lower HDIs associated with higher obesity %")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}

- Summarizes numerical variable
- Five-number summary: sample minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, sample maximum
- Outliers
- Spread and skew
- (More on all these later!)
:::

## Histograms

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  ggplot(aes(x=Obesity)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "deeppink4", 
                 fill = "goldenrod2",
                 bins = 20) +
  ggtitle("Most states have approx. 30% adult obesity")
```

:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}

- Summarizes numerical variable
- Five-number summary: sample minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, sample maximum
- Outliers
- Spread and skew
- (More on all these later!)
:::

## Line plots

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  filter(State %in% c("California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", "Delaware")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = State, y = InfantMortalityRate, group_by = State)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Infant mortality rate by State")

```

:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}

- Summarizes numerical variable (most often used across time)
- Each value on x-axis corresponds to only one measurement on y-axis (and vice versa)
- Often used to depict change over time and connected with line.

::: {.callout-warning title="Question"}
Is the plot on the left useful?

## Scatterplots

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{r fig.height = 8, fig.width = 7, fig.asp=1}
cdc |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Exercise, y = Obesity)) +
  geom_point() + 
  facet_grid(. ~ HDI) +
  ggtitle("Adequate aerobic activity associated with lower obesity") +
  xlab("Adequate aerobic activity (%)")

```

:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size: 70%;"}

- Shows relationship between multiple continuous measurements

- You can add color, shape, transparency, etc to further differentiate by category

## Some best practices

- Keep it simple
- Summarize and highlight
- Tell a story with the plot (use "active titles")
- If possible, replace text with visuals


## Recap

- Biostatistics involves a broad range of activities that help us improve the intellectual content of data from biological, biomedical, and public health-related studies; it is more than just a compilation of computational methods. 

- Measurement is assigning numbers or codes according to prior-set rules

- Data quality: garbage in, garbage out. Imprecision and bias.
- Exploratory data analysis: initial data analysis that summarizes key aspects of data
